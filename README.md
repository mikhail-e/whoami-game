# Who am I?

![The sign and the game room: player cards with their characters pinned on as tags, your own a sealed envelope](public/img/og-image-2.jpg)

The classic guessing party game, played remotely. Every player gets a secret character chosen by the others and asks yes/no questions to find out who they are. Create a room, send the link to friends and family, play — no accounts, nothing to install.

**Play:** https://whoami-game.onrender.com/

## Features

- Rooms with a 6-character code and a link to share (the Share button opens the phone's share sheet)
- Players assign characters to each other; your own stays hidden until you reveal it
- Emoji avatars or your own photo
- English and Russian
- Reconnects after a lost connection
- Installable as an app (PWA); needs an internet connection

## How to Run

Running the game needs Node.js 18 or newer; the development tools (ESLint) need Node.js 20.19+, 22.13+ or 24+.

```bash
npm install
npm start          # http://localhost:3000
```

## Development

```bash
npx playwright install chromium   # once: the browser for the browser tests
npm test           # all checks: ESLint, Jest, then the game in a real browser (Playwright)
npm run lint       # ESLint only
npm run test:e2e   # browser tests only: a phone and a desktop, several players per room
```

## License

The code is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

The license does not cover the game's brand: the "WHO AM I?" sign (`svg.brand-sign` in the pages), the wax-seal app icon (`public/icons/`, `public/favicon.ico`, `scripts/icon.html`) and the link preview picture (`public/img/og-image-2.jpg`, `scripts/og-image.html`). All rights to them are reserved (except the emoji avatars in the picture, drawn by the system's emoji font); a copy of the game must replace them with its own.

Third-party files keep their own licenses: the fonts in `public/fonts/` (SIL Open Font License; Ultra — Apache License 2.0; the license files are next to the fonts) and Bootstrap in `public/vendor/bootstrap/` (MIT). The cup in the Buy Me a Coffee button (`public/img/bmc-cup.svg`) is Buy Me a Coffee's logo.
